# MyProjects
Virtual Coach
1. Should call for a daily reminder and pushes me to workout.
2. A WhatsApp integration, where I have to send my workouts, diets and activity and progress tracker images.
3. Should be able to read images and respond back.
4. Should hold me accountable for staying disciplined. 
5. Should be able to check my screen time and respond towards productivity.
6. Able to call me for reminders and if not proper response on WhatsApp should remind me again.
7. Should be able to present my progress.
8. I should be able to add traits to this model. Like knowledge of a billionaire.
9. For now this communication is via calls. In future, I will give a face to this virtual person.
